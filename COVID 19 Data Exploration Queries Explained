#COVID-19 Data Exploration

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Exploration project! This repository contains SQL queries used to explore COVID-19 data, focusing on various metrics such as total cases, total deaths, vaccination rates, and more.

Skills Used:
Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Key Queries:

1. Selecting Relevant Data: Initial queries select relevant data from the dataset, filtering out null values and ordering results for clarity.

2. Total Cases vs Total Deaths: Analyzes the likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in a specific location, such as Germany, by calculating the percentage of deaths among total cases.

3. Total Cases vs Population: Shows the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in a specific location, such as Germany.

4. Countries with Highest Infection Rate: Identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population, highlighting areas of concern.

5. Countries with Highest Death Count: Lists countries with the highest death count per population, providing insights into the severity of the pandemic in different regions.

6. Breakdown by Continent: Analyzes death counts per population at a continental level, revealing insights into the impact of COVID-19 across different continents.

7. Global Numbers: Calculates global totals for new cases, total deaths, and death percentages.

8. Total Population vs Vaccinations: Examines the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.

9. Using CTEs and Temp Tables: Demonstrates the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables to perform calculations and store intermediate results.

10. Creating Views: Creates a view to store data for later visualizations or further analysis.
